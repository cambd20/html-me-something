            <p id= "introduction">From what I can understand, a lot of people outside of the midwest don't know much about KC or simply just have a misunderstanding about the city. For example, many don't even realize that most of the city is located in Missouri as opposed to Kansas. I have composed a list of 5 great things that KC has to offer!</p>

            <h1>BBQ</h1>
            <p>There are literally hundreds of barbecue places scattered across the metro, all with their own unique style. Places like Q39, KC Joe's, Jack Stack, and Gates are sure to send you home feeling satisfied. I, personally, am a Jack Stack advocate. However, that may be a bit biased since that is my current place of employment.</p>
